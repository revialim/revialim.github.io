  <p>Once upon a time there was a little fox. He was looking for a good home. When he was walking across a meadow, he saw a big old oak standing alone in the middle of the meadow.
  </p>

  <div class="story-img"><img src="./imgs/little-fox/fox-tree.jpg"/></div>

  <p>He went over to the oak and asked her: “Do you know where I can find a nice home?” The oak said: “Take a look on my other side.”</p>

  <p>On one side the oak had a hole large enough to fit the little fox and the fox thought it would make a good home. “Thank you!” he said.</p>

  <p>So he leapt through the hole in the bark...</p>

  <p>It was dark inside the oak. The fox's eyes adjusted and what he saw was a little family of three owls waking up and looking at him. “Oh, is this your home already?” the fox asked them. “Yes, it is.” mother owl replied. “You will have to look somewhere else for a home.”</p>

  <p>The little fox left the hole in the oak tree and went searching for a different place.</p>

  <div class="story-img"><img src="./imgs/little-fox/fox-bear_1.jpg"/></div>

  <p>The next place was a cave surrounded by mosses and ferns. It looked a little bit damp and chilly, but with a few adjustments it should be just fine, the fox thought.</p>

  <p>So he went closer to take a look inside the cave, when suddenly...</p>

  <p>RAWR! – There was a bear inside the cave! The bear just woke up and bellowed: "Get out! This is my cave!"</p>

  <p>And the fox ran away as fast as he could.</p>

  <p>He ran into a forest of beech trees and when he slowed down he realised there was a small hole in the ground. He slipped through and found himself inside a nice burrow. It was rumbling behind him from the entrance and when the little fox turned around he saw a badger. Surprised and a little unsettled by his previous encounters, the fox said "I'm sorry, I didn't– " –"Oh hello! Are you a fox? I am Mister Badger. Be my guest!", the badger said, "I haven't had a guest for ages!"</p>

  <p>So for this night the little fox stayed over at the badger's place. Mister Badger's home was really comfortable and it made the fox want a home of his own even more. Well rested on the next morning he said Good Bye to Mister Badger and Mister Badger wished him Good Luck for his search.</p>

  <p>When the little fox left the forest, he found a meadow lying in front of him. Many flowers were blooming among this meadow and many bees were busily flying from flower to flower, collecting nectar.</p>

  <div class="story-img"><img src="./imgs/little-fox/fox-bee.jpg"/></div>

  <p>The little fox stood next to a yellow flower with many petals and a bee came over and landed on it. He grasped his opportunity and asked the bee: "Hello, Mrs. Bee! I'm looking for a good home. Do you know where I can search?" – "Oh, hello, I didn't notice you there. And yes, yesterday I was flying on the other side of the meadow and I think I've seen something that you would call home beneath one of the trees there." – the bee replied. The little fox thanked her and started walking across the meadow.</p>
  
  <p>When he reached the woods on the other side, he could already see a tree growing on top of a little hill with a small hole at its roots. The little fox went inside the burrow and  no one was there. Nor were there any signs of another animal. Some old leaves that might have been blown in by the wind and the roots of the tree above were visible. The little fox found a new home. He was very happy, but at the same time felt very tired all of a sudden. So he decided to take a nap before adding more furniture (dry leaves and grass).</p>
  
  <p>After he took his nap and carried in dried leaves and grass and some well smelling herbs to make a bed, the sun was already standing low over the horizon. The little fox sat in front of the burrow finally with a new home that was all his and watching the sun set over the meadow.</p>

  <p>The end</p>
